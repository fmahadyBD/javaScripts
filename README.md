In JavaScript, there are several ways to declare variables:<br>

1) var: This is the traditional way to declare a variable in JavaScript. Variables declared with var are function-scoped,<br>
which means that they are accessible within the function in which they are declared, as well as any functions that are<br>
nested within that function.<br>

2) let: This keyword was introduced in JavaScript as part of the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) specification. It is used to<br>
declare a block-scoped variable, which means that it is only accessible within the block in which it is declared. <br>
A block is a piece of code that is enclosed within curly braces, such as the body of an if statement or a for loop.<br>

3) const: This keyword was also introduced in JavaScript as part of the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) specification. It is used <br>
to declare a constant, which is a variable that cannot be re-assigned a different value after it has been declared. <br>
Constants are also block-scoped, just like variables declared with let.<br>

In addition to these ways to declare variables, there are also several data types that can be used in JavaScript:<br>

4) string: This is used to represent a sequence of characters, such as a word or a phrase. Strings are denoted by<br>
enclosing the characters in single or double quotes.<br>

5) number: This is used to represent numerical values, such as integers or floating-point numbers.<br>

6) boolean: This is used to represent a true or false value.<br>

7) null: This represents a null value, which indicates the absence of a value or a null reference.<br>

8) undefined: This represents a value that has not been assigned a value yet.<br>

9) object: This is a complex data type that can contain multiple properties and methods. Objects are used to store<br>
and organize data in a more structured way.<br>

10) symbol: This is a unique data type that was introduced in JavaScript as part of the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)<br>
specification. It is used to create unique identifiers for objects.<br>

11) function: This is a block of code that can be executed when it is called. Functions can accept input in the<br>
form of arguments, and they can return a value when they are executed.<br>
